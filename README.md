# Mondrian Generator 4
The program creates Mondrian pattern images for implementing the Continuous Flash Suppression procedure. Images are of user-defined size (DPI based) and are saved in the "mondrians" directory (created if not present).

It is possible to choose between circles and squares, and between coloured or grayscale images.

Version 4.0 works great via command line. cd inside the folder and call: python mondrian_generator_4.py

Have fun!
