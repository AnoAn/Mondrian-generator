# Mondrian Generator 2.0
The program creates Mondrian pattern images of size 600x600 pixels and saves them in the "Images" folder.
It is possible to choose between circles and squares, and between coloured or grayscale images. The 'Shape size proportion parameter allows to set the size range of the shapes. Have fun!
